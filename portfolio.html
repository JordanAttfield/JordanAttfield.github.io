            <p>Hey. I'm Jordan. I grew up in a country town in NSW but moved to Sydney in 2015 and eventually settled in Brisbane last year. </p><p>My background is in accounting and psychology. I've worked in various accounting positions since uni and to be honest I've always found it to be incredibly unfulfilling work and so boring.</p><p>
            I'm so excited to learn new skills in this web development course - my best friend and I started playing around with HTML and very basic CSS when we were around 10 years old, and would sell our old clothes and toys on eBay and created elaborate looking ebay listings with our basic design skills!</p>
           <p>In my spare time you'll always find me in a bookstore. I also have the biggest sweet tooth so I'm constantly baking - I'm a complete brownie addict!</p>Here's a link to my resume
